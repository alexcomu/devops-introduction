## 01 Introduction to devops

A quick introduction on **DEVOPS**.

## 02 Provisioning

What is **provisioning**? How can we use it to improve our development and deployment?

### - Vagrant

How to use Vagrant for development environments.

## 03 Automation and Configuration Management

Use configuration and Management tools to automate the installation and configuration of the software.

### - Ansible

Ansible is a free-software platform for configuring and managing computers which combines multi-node software deployment, ad hoc task execution, and configuration management.

### - Chef

Chef is used to streamline the task of configuring and maintaining a company's servers, and can integrate with cloud-based platforms such as Internap, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack, SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace to automatically provision and configure new machines. Chef contains solutions for both small and large scale systems, with features and pricing for the respective ranges.

## 04 Continuos Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

### - Jenkins

Jenkins is an open source automation server written in Java, it helps to automate the non-human part of the whole software development process, with now common things like continuous integration, but by further empowering teams to implement the technical part of a Continuous Delivery. It is a server-based system running in a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat

## 05 Container - Docker

Introduction to **microservices** and **Docker Engine**.
