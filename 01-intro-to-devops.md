# What is DevOps

DevOps is an approach to bridge the gap between software development and operations:

* It's a response to the interdependence of software web development and IT operations
* DevOps is not a technology problem, but a business and cultural problem
* Stresses collaboration between development and operations
* Aims to deliver software and services quicker
